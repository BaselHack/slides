### BaselHack Sponsoring

BaselHack has taken place each year since 2017, always with the *help* of sponsoring. 

For a sponsor, participating at BaselHack is an ideal instrument
for *Employer Branding*, *Recruiting* and *Digitization Campaigns*.

### Challenges

Each participant decides on a *team* and a *project* at the beginning of the hackathon.
They either work on a *freestyle challenge* or a *sponsored challenge*
Gold and main sponsors can, for an additional fee, set up a Challenge
with fixed prize money, e.g. to arrive at a code prototype for a concrete digitalisation problem as part of the hackathon.

In addition, main sponsors can also award a *special prize* across all teams, in relation to defined
criteria in an overarching concern (e.g. sustainability award).
